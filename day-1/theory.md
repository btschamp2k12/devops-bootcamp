## Day 1 ##

- **Understand Devops basics.**
  DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the software development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. It involves collaboration, automation, and monitoring at all stages of software development.

- **Relation with agile approach and how devops fit in.**
  * "Agile sets the goals, DevOps figures out how to achieve them."  
  * Agile methodology articulates the principles of iterative development and customer collaboration, while DevOps operationalizes these principles through the integration of development and operations teams, leveraging practices such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation."

- **Perform [Lab-1](Lab-1.md)

- **Automate everything but why?**
  Automation is a core principle of DevOps. By automating repetitive tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software, teams can increase efficiency, reduce errors, and deliver software faster and more reliably. Automation also enables continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which are essential for DevOps practices.
