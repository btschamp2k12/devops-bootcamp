## Day 1 ##

- **Understand Devops basics.**
  DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the software development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. It involves collaboration, automation, and monitoring at all stages of software development.

- **Relation with agile approach and how devops fit in.**
  DevOps and Agile share similar principles, such as collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development. Agile focuses on short development cycles and customer feedback, while DevOps extends these principles to include the entire software delivery process, from development to deployment and operations.

- **Automate everything but why?**
  Automation is a core principle of DevOps. By automating repetitive tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software, teams can increase efficiency, reduce errors, and deliver software faster and more reliably. Automation also enables continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which are essential for DevOps practices.

- **Understand `monolith` and `microservice`.**
  In software architecture, a monolith is a single, unified application where all components are tightly integrated and deployed together. Microservices architecture breaks down the application into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices offer benefits such as scalability, agility, and fault isolation, but they also introduce complexity in terms of deployment and management.

- **Understand `docker`.**
  Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that package an application and its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different environments. Docker simplifies the process of building, deploying, and managing applications by providing a standardized way to package and distribute software.
